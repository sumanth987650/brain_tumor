You can directly run as (Saved previously to model.h5 and model.json):
1. Open Anaconda Prompt 
2. cd to the brain_tumor directory
3. Run the command: "streamlit run host.py"


If you want to retrain the model again then:
1. Open Jupyter notebook
2. cd to the brain_tumor_directory
3. Run all the cells from Brain Tumor Detection.ipynb (To retrain the model with some changes)
